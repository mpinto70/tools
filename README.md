# tools

Repository of useful tools that I developed and use on a day-to-day basis.

## python

In `python` directory are the tools written in python. Each will have its own subdirectory.
Subdirectory `lib` is for common libraries.

To run Python unit tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python python python/tests
```
